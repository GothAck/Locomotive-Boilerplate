### Locomotive Boilerplate with Addons!
#### Mongoose, Generated Forms, Emailer & Authentication

Inspired by Turbo87's https://github.com/Turbo87/locomotive-passport-boilerplate. I've borrowed a few ideas & authentication (Passport) and developed a Mongoose Forms generation module (see forms-mongoose) and added an emailer (NodeMailer). Hopefully this will provide people a platform, or inspiration, to work from when creating their own Locomotive services!

Any questions please email me!
